# [aircall.io](https://aircall.io) - Frontend technical test

**This test is now deprecated. Please refer to [this one](https://github.com/aircall/frontend-hiring-test/blob/master/README.md) instead. **

This test is a part of our hiring process at Aircall for [the Frontend Developer position](https://jobs.lever.co/aircall/c0fdd41e-a2a1-408d-ad08-890153518587). It should take you between 3 and 6 hours depending on your experience.

**Feel free to apply! Drop us a line with your LinkedIn/GitHub/Twitter at jobs@aircall.io**

## Summary

The goal of this test is to make you code a small ReactJS app. We have prepared a skeleton app for you, but please change whatever you want (CSS files, HTML structure, JS structure...).

The app will have two different components:
- **Activity Feed** - simple list of calls
- **Activity Detail** - detail of a call

Show us what you can do in 6 hours top :) Don't spend too much time on designing your app, our design team will hate it anyway.

**Bonus:** the final user should be able to archive a call. The call will no longer be displayed on the Activity Feed. Please code that only if you have extra time.


To give you an idea, here what our app looks like:
